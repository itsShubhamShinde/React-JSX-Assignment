    <p>Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold shoes. Today, we still sell shoes - as well as </p>
    <p>clothing, handbags, accessories, and more. That more is providing the very best customer service, customer</p>
    <p>experience, and company culture. We aim to inspire the world by showing it's possible to simultaneously deliver</p>
    <p>happiness to customers, employees, vendors, shareholders, and the community in a long-term, sustainable way.</p>

    <p>We hope that in the future people won't even realize we started selling shoes online. Instead, they'll know Zappos as a </p>
    <p>service company that just happens to sell________.</p>
